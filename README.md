# Dotfiles

My dotfiles.

## Prerequisites

You need `git` to clone the repository and `stow` to link files to the
appropriate places.

## Installation

Clone the repository to `$HOME/.dotfiles`. The directory name may be something
other than `.dotfiles`, but it must be in the `$HOME` directory so that `stow`
creates links in the right place.

Use `stow` on each desired bundle.
